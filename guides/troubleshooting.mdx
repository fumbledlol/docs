## My profile is not updating immediately

Make sure you refresh your profile a few times after doing changes. Updates may take a short moment to appear because cached (stored) data can temporarily show the previous version of your profile.

## I get 403 errors saying "Request forbidden by administrative rules."

Your request has been blocked by our security filters. There may be a single or multiple factors why this happened.

If you get a 403 Request forbidden error when trying to log in, or access your profile's dashboard, make sure that you are not using Tor or a proxy that uses Datacenter IP's.

You can try some of these to fix the error:

- Check your browser extensions for any extension that may be interfering with your requests.
- Use another network connection if possible.
- Enable JavaScript for the website/browser. Fumbled wont work without JavaScript anyways.

If you believe this is an error, please contact support with your IP address and the time of the incident.

## I'm not getting any emails, such as email verification. etc..

If you are having trouble receiving automated emails from us, please:

- Double-check your email address.
- Check your spam folder, sometimes our emails might get flagged as spammy.
- Wait a few minutes for the email to appear to your inbox/spam folder.

If you believe that you accidentally registered with a wrong email address (accidental typo, e.g.) please contact us and provide your username, and the location where you registered from. We may be able to help with changing your email to correct one and verify it manually as you contact us.
