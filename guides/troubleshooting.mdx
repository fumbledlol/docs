## Discord integration not showing data properly

If you encounter any issues, such as that your status is not being shown correctly, or your activity status is not showing up, make sure you have enabled Activity status from the server's privacy settings.

## My profile is not updating immediately

Make sure you refresh your profile a few times after doing changes. Updates may take a short moment to appear because cached (stored) data can temporarily show the previous version of your profile.

## I'm getting 403 Forbidden errors

Your request has been blocked by our security filters. There may be a single or multiple factors why this happened.

You can try some of these to fix the error:

- Check your browser extensions for any extension that may be interfering with your requests.
- Use another network connection if possible.
- Enable JavaScript for the website/browser. Fumbled wont work without JavaScript anyways.

If you believe this is an error, please contact support with your IP address and the time of the incident.

### VPN/Tor/Proxy users

We allow Tor and Datacenter IP (likely personal vpn/proxy) users to normally view limited pages such as user profiles and other static pages. Trying to log in and update profile however is not possible due to prevent abuse.

VPN users may continue to use the platform without issues. However if you use a VPN provider that is not too known publicly, there may be issues.

## I'm not getting any emails, such as email verification. etc..

If you are having trouble receiving automated emails from us, please:

- Double-check your email address.
- Check your spam folder, sometimes our emails might get flagged as spammy.
- Wait a few minutes for the email to appear to your inbox/spam folder.

If you believe that you accidentally registered with a wrong email address (accidental typo, e.g.) please email us with the email address you want to use, and provide your username, and the location where you registered from. We may be able to help with changing your email to correct one and verify it manually as you contact us.
